This repository is a centralized hub for data involved in [Ian Fisher](https://iafisher.com/)'s [CityQuiz](https://cityquiz.io/).

This repository is not being run by Ian Fisher, and so any data found here is not guarenteed to currently or ever be implemented in CityQuiz.

The contents of this repository are broken down by continent. In each continent's md file, every country and territory (according to CityQuiz) is listed in alphabetical order. If a country/territory has been compiled (its data has been fully organized), then there will be a link to a repository with said data. If a country/territory has not yet been compiled, it will simply be blank.

Note: Russia and Spain are only included in europe.md, and Turkey is only included in asia.md.
